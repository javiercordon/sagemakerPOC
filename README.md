# sagemaker-POC
Sagemaker Proof of Concept without extra feature engineering in data input

## Background
Getting customized models may be time consuming compared to auto ML or auto Tunning available from Cloud providers as AWS. We would like to have as a reference what could be te minimum accuracy target we could get when designing a customized model.

## Description
This project has 3 different notebooks to address LinearModel specific accuracy target training, XGBoost Hyper Parameter auto Tunning, and AutoPilot.

## Usage
Run each of the 3 main jupyter notebooks downloading dataset. In this case data has been previously clean from empty values, and categories turned into a number.
